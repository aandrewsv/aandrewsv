### Who I am?
Hello! üëã My name is Agust√≠n, and I'm passionate about technology. I consider myself an empathetic and sociable person who loves learning new things, especially when working collaboratively. For the past three years, I've been working as a full-stack developer, collaborating with various teams and clients to deliver modern projects and technological solutions. In each work experience, I've applied my expertise in cloud services to optimize processes and significantly reduce costs, enhancing project efficiency and profitability.

I'm a proud bootcamp graduate developer from [CodingDojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/) where I got my Black belt on 2020 and mostly self taught person. I have realized over the years that knowledge comes from sharing it and helping with others through specific communities of the technologies which one feels most comfortable working with. I'm very inclined to new tech trends as I'm genuinely curious about it and love to try new things that may improve productivity around my different workflows.

### What I am doing right now?
- üíº I‚Äôm currently working on [SemSo](https://semso.cl/)
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning React Native, getting better with Docker and exploring different ways to code AI powered Whatsapp Chatbots


### üõ†Ô∏è What's my tech stack?

Here's a list of the technologies I'm most experienced with:

- Frontend systems with React and Vue, preferably with Typescript
- Relational databases including PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for backend systems using Django and the power and simplicity of Python
- Serverless cloud service management or Terraform
- Progressive Web Applications (PWA) with React and mobile applications with React Native
- CI/CD with Bitbucket Pipelines and Agile methodologies using the Scrum framework
- Python scripts with Selenium for browser automated testing

Typically, I deploy my projects to cloud service providers (CSP). While I've had some exposure to Google Cloud Platform, I have more experience with Amazon Web Services. In fact, I obtained the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and am enthusiastic about furthering my expertise in this area.

Feel free to reach out if you need assistance with any of the technologies mentioned here, or if you'd like to discuss job opportunities, interesting projects, or exchange ideas regarding the relevance of these technologies.
